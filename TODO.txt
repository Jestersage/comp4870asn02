==Report generation==
*ASP.NET AJAX (Omeed)
**Generate report based on Excel
**a menu item on your home page that leads to a page that generates ad-hoc filtered reports using ASP.NET MVC

*AngularJS (George)
**Generate report based on Excel
**create a plain old Report.html page that generates the same ad-hoc filtered reports as above using AngularJS. Report.html can be run from a client machine that uses CORS & authentication to communicate with your WebAPI service on Azure. In addition, Report.html can be run on the server at the root directory of your site.

Report.html placed in site root directory
Reports can be generated on a remote client desktop/laptop by loading Report.html, and all its dependencies (*.js, *.css, & *.html) in Visual Studio on a client desktop/laptop computer. 
Report filters based on month & year generate correct reports
Reports look professional


? (May be solved)
* contents of your drop-down-lists are not visible unless you scroll over them. ???

==API side situation==
*Lookup table okay
*Unable to load all clients, but can call specific clients by api/Clients/n where n is the number


Notes
* resolve icollection issue by using annotation  [JsonIgnore] or [Newtonsoft.Json.JsonIgnore] on ICollection
